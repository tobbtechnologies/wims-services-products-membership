3.Background
------------

The growth of IT industry has gender imbalance and WIMS aims to address that worldwide. 
International Labour Organization(ILO) research in 2018 found this, "...despite the progress made thus far and the global commitments to secure further improvement,
women’s prospects in the world of work are far from being equal to men’s."(Source: https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_619577.pdf
).

Also the UN 2030 Agenda, "seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls".
(Source: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld). And specifically declaration no 20 
 seeks to achieve, "gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls".
 
With this challenge stated above, WIMS positively contributes to this goal without being gender biased as stated 
in WIMS White Paper (https://wims.io/assets/uploads/wp-wims-version-7.2.pdf).

Achieving the above is being approached in many ways but WIMS has chosen these :
utilization of blockchain Technology because of its strength - temper proof database, decentralized, globally
easy to use, connects all people anywhere and anytime. With blockchain WIMS is able to connect and assist any woman
globally.

WIMS was founded in 2018, established membership from different countries, created Ethereum blockchain based 
80Billion WIMTs which are digital assets(Recognized by South African Reserve Bank) to be used for membership
tracking, rewards, participation remuneration, services/products discounts. Above all WIMT are medium of 
WIMS value exchange globally.

WIMS has established, safe and credible online platforms and over 5 social media channels and over 300 followers and over
20 volunteers.

In 2020 ByteTrade a successful Chinese based Blockchain company partnered with WIMS and created wimsbytetrade.com which is a 
digital assets tranferring platform. They enlised WIMT and enabled transfers of WIMS digital assets within wimsbytetrade.com 
have zero transaction fees.
This is great in that women can transact WIMTs at wimsbytetrade.com for free unlike at Ethereum where each transaction
has to pay gas fees.

WIMS profit made from wimsbytetrade.com and other activities will be distributed as follows: women will get 60% because this 
project is for empowering them, WIMS gets 20% and ByteTrade 20% for their operational costs and contributions.

4.WIMS Membership:
------------------

Please NOTE: WIMS and ByteTrade are not pyramid schemes, not a church, not ideological movement, not a charity organization, are not aiming at profiting 
from women exploitation but are efforts to achieve UN 2030 goals stated above within global legal jusdiction since WIMS is 
global by nature.

This means the membership required is needed for fair, safe and effective resource distribution within WIMS ecosystem without being scammed.

Should any activity violates these above stated values anyone is welcome to quickly report these activities and WIMS must 
quickly rectify them.

Participation is never by force, hook and crook, but by free will and knowingly. This therefore prohibits 
activities like pyramid schemes, collection of member monies for investment purposes and the like. WIMS is a service/product
based global solution. Protection of members and the public consumers comes first. Compliance with national and international
regulatory requirements is a must. However WIMS does not want regidity in this implementation to such an extend of 
denying the need women assistance and benefits they deserve.

With this in mind, WIMS membership will be tracked and traced globally via possession of WIMT as stated in the share holding 
article,"Any WIMS voting, member or key stakeholder is to have 1000WIMTs as a minimum. 1000WIMT  will be equal to 1 WIMT Vote(WV) 
and 1 WIMT Vote will be equal to 1 stake i.e 1WS (WIMT Stake) = 1000WIMT = 1 vote. Entry level membership requires 1WS/1000WIMT/1WV"(https://github.com/wimsio/wims-share-holding-and-benefits/blob/master/share-holding)

5. Growth Strategies
--------------------

All organisations are powered by membership growth strategies and WIMS will use fair and transparent ones like referral systems. Due to 
lots of pyramid schemes which have robbed many members money and disappeared, WIMS will only adher to 'Consumer Protection Act (CPA)' approved referral systems based on direct sales of services and products. Should WIMS activities be out of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) of any country where WIMS has members then those activities must be reported and terminated immediately or changed and the affected losing public people must receive a public apology and/or restitution where possible.

It will benefit WIMS to grow itselft in both quantity and quality.

6.Summary:
----------

1. Membership 1000WIMT at 10USDT($10) = $0.01/WIMT. Update: 10 ADA are now required or equivalent crypto.
2. Buy  USDT @ wimsbytetrade.com or else where and get 1000WIMTs at wimsbytetrade.

Women or Women Empowering Businesses that do not afford to pay the once off membership $10(USDT), must be allowed to participate in WIMS activities which will help them make profit. When they can afford then they must pay the little once off $10.

Should any Women not have the 1000WIMTs but needs services to start and run her business then she will be loaned 1000WIMTs 
and is to pay the $10 later when she makes profit from her business.

Minors and people from prohibited countries(Every member must check with her/his country for legality) are not allowed to join WIMS ecosystem.

If your church or organization deems WIMS a risk and says do not take part then follow your organization, family, country or religion.

However, WIMS has carefully put in place structures to accommodate everyone as per UN 2030 goals. All countries are 
members of the UN and WIMS must at all times comply with UN requirements.
